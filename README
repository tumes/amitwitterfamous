This is an extremely silly thing I did to see if I could do it. Originally I did a lot of it in controller methods, but having jQuery ajax controller methods seemed a bit silly when I realized I could just do nearly the whole thing in jQuery. I commented out the controller stuff in case I decide to add a hidden API for the hell of it.

I'm continuously going to play with refactoring because I know quite a lot of the javascript is messy.
